                <h1><i>Flavor Text for inspiration:</i></h1>
                <p>The year is 20XX, in the cities the American Government has surrendered its authority to the
                    corporations, allowing them to run their economic zones however they wish while the rural areas have
                    been devastated by climate change, pollution by genetic engineering, and poverty. Now along the
                    American
                    Gulf Coasts, the only way to survive outside the city is for small communities to rely on
                    bootleggers
                    and smugglers who are brave enough to travel the super highways and backroads with stolen tech and
                    food.
                    These men and women call themselves Bandits. This game setting is powered by Paizo's Starfinder 2e
                    rules
                    and takes inspiration from 1970s film and television as well as cyberpunk material like Akira and
                    Johnny
                    Mnemonic.

                    <br></br>The illustration would be a take on Akira with a young man in a cowboy hat and leather
                    jacket
                    walking towards a sleek, futuristic sports car like that is covered in mud. The young man has a
                    cybernetic left arm and a patch on the back of his jacket that says <strong> <i>“How’s My
                            Driving?”</i></strong>
